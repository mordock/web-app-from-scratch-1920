## Description
This app shows you random star wars characters with info about them. It show the name, gender, birthday and mass of those characters. 
I made this use no external libraries other than 2 micro libraries using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Features
You can get 6 random Star Wars characters and click to see some more info about them. There's also a randomize button to show new characters

## API
This app used the Star wars API.

You can ask for certain character from such a link: 
https://swapi.co/api/people/1/
This is what the returned objects look like:
